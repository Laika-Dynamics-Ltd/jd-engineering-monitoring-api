# Railway Auto-Deployment Setup Guide

## ✅ Files Updated for Automation

### 1. Enhanced `railway.json`
- Added automatic build triggers for file changes
- Optimized deployment configuration  
- Added environment variables for production

### 2. Created `.railwayignore`
- Excludes unnecessary files from deployment
- Faster build times by ignoring docs, tests, cache files
- Optimized for production deployments

### 3. Startup Script (`start.sh`)
- Handles dynamic PORT variable from Railway
- Proper environment detection and logging
- Ensures reliable container startup

## 🚀 To Enable Full Auto-Deployment:

### Railway Dashboard Settings:
1. **Go to Railway Dashboard**: https://railway.app/dashboard
2. **Select your project**: `jd-engineering-monitoring-api`
3. **Click on the service** (jd-engineering-monitoring-api)
4. **Go to Settings tab**
5. **In the "Source Repo" section**:
   - ✅ Ensure GitHub repo is connected
   - ✅ Set branch to `main`
   - ✅ Enable "Auto-Deploy on Push"
   - ✅ Set "Deploy on PR" to OFF (optional)

### GitHub Repository Settings:
1. **Webhook should be automatically configured**
2. **Check Repository → Settings → Webhooks**
3. **Verify Railway webhook is present and active**

## 📋 Current Automation Status:

- ✅ **Dockerfile**: Optimized for Railway with startup script
- ✅ **Health Check**: Automated endpoint monitoring
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Restart policy configured
- ✅ **Port Management**: Dynamic PORT variable support
- ✅ **Build Optimization**: File exclusions for faster deployments

## 🔄 Auto-Deployment Flow:

1. **Code Push** → GitHub main branch
2. **Webhook Trigger** → Railway detects changes
3. **Automatic Build** → Using Dockerfile + requirements.txt
4. **Health Check** → Verifies /health endpoint
5. **Live Deployment** → Automatic rollout to production URL

## ⚙️ Environment Variables Set:

- `PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1` - Real-time logging
- `PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1` - Optimized container
- `DATABASE_URL` - Automatic PostgreSQL connection
- `PORT` - Dynamic port assignment from Railway

## 🎯 Result:

Every push to `main` branch will automatically:
1. Trigger build on Railway
2. Deploy without manual approval  
3. Health check verification
4. Live at: https://jd-engineering-monitoring-api-production.up.railway.app

**No more manual deployment approvals needed!**
