Hi Brad,

Daily update for 30 June:

Tablet Testing Requirements:

Before proceeding with further security bypass script testing, I need to ensure our test environments are properly updated:

• Both test tablets require latest TeamViewer and Android versions
• This will ensure compatibility and accurate testing results for the security bypass implementation

Access Request:

Could you please let me know a convenient time this morning when I can connect to our test tablet? I'd like to:
• Verify current software versions
• Test and confirm the security bypass script functionality
• Complete any necessary updates

Additionally, are you happy for me to connect to the tablet in the plasma department for further testing this morning? This would help validate the solution across different deployment scenarios.

Dashboard Status:
• Recent improvements deployed successfully
• Password login issue resolved (thanks for catching that spacing issue!)
• Can you confirm dashboard access is working properly for you now?

I'll aim to have all tablet testing completed by mid-morning and will provide an update on results.

Cheers,

Joe
