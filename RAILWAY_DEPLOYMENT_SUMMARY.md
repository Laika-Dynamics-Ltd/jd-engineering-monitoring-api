python3 -c "import secrets; print('API_TOKEN=' + secrets.token_urlsafe(32))"
python3 -c "import secrets; print('JWT_SECRET=' + secrets.token_urlsafe(32))"
```

### 3. Setup Railway Project
```bash
# Option A: New project
railway init

# Option B: Link existing
railway link
```

### 4. Add PostgreSQL Service
In Railway Dashboard:
- Add Service → PostgreSQL
- Wait for deployment

### 5. Configure Environment Variables
In Railway Dashboard → Variables:
