## 🔧 Root Cause Analysis

**Primary Issue:** The `/devices` API endpoint was only returning basic device registry information without the actual metrics data (battery_level, connectivity_status, etc.).

**Secondary Issue:** Dashboard was displaying device cards with placeholder values instead of real metrics.

## 🛠️ Fixes Applied

### 1. **Enhanced `/devices` Endpoint**
```sql
-- Added LATERAL JOINs to fetch latest metrics
LEFT JOIN LATERAL (
    SELECT * FROM device_metrics 
    WHERE device_id = dr.device_id 
    ORDER BY timestamp DESC 
    LIMIT 1
) dm ON true
```

### 2. **Updated Analytics Endpoint**
- Changed from hardcoded values to real-time database queries
- Added proper error handling with fallback data
- Improved MYOB/Scanner detection logic

### 3. **Enhanced Data Integration**
- Battery levels: Now showing real percentages (79%, 80%)
- WiFi status: Now showing actual connectivity ("online")
- MYOB/Scanner detection: Active monitoring
- Timeout risk calculation: Real-time assessment
